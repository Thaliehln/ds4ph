## Introduction

### Overview

This tutorial is adapted from the excellent [Machine learning in Python with scikit-learn](https://www.fun-mooc.fr/en/courses/machine-learning-python-scikit-learn/)

### Learning objectives

-   explore data
-   prepare data
-   fit a **k-nearest neighbors** model on a training dataset
-   evaluate its generalization performance on the testing data

## Question

We are interested in predicting the age of the child based on height and weight measured during the consultation.

-   **MEAS_weight_in_kg** and
-   **MEAS_height_in_cm**.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
library(tidyverse) # includes dplyr and tibble
library(skimr)
library(ggplot2)
library(DataExplorer)
library(reticulate)
```

## Load the data

The dataset is stored in **dataset4.xlsx**.

Read the dataset and store it into a dataframe called **df**.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
df <- openxlsx::read.xlsx("./data/dataset4.xlsx")
```

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
df <- df %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    SDC_age_category = dplyr::case_when(
      SDC_age_in_months < 12 ~ "<11 months",
      SDC_age_in_months >= 12 & SDC_age_in_months < 36 ~ "12-35 months",
      SDC_age_in_months >= 36 & SDC_age_in_months < 60 ~ "36-59 months",
      TRUE ~ ""
    )
  ) %>%
  tibble::remove_rownames() %>%
  tibble::column_to_rownames(var="child_ID") %>%
  dplyr::mutate(across(c(SDC_sex,
                         SDC_age_category), factor))
```

## Data exploration

We want to do some data exploration to get an initial understanding of the data. Before building a predictive model, it is always a good idea to look at the data:

-   maybe the task you are trying to achieve can be solved without machine learning;
-   you need to check that the information you need for your task is actually present in the dataset;
-   inspecting the data is a good way to find peculiarities. These can arise during data collection (for example, malfunctioning sensor or missing values), or from the way the data is processed afterwards (for example capped values).

### Data structure

::: panel-tabset
#### :pencil2: Exercise 1

Examine the structure of the data, including variable names, labels.

1.  How many features are numerical?
2.  How many features are categorical?

Display the variables/features **child_id**, **MEAS_weight_in_kg** and **MEAS_height_in_cm** for the **10 first samples** in the data.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
# Write your code here
```

#### R

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
df %>%
  skimr::skim()
```

:::

Numerical variables can be naturally handled by machine learning algorithms that are typically composed of a sequence of arithmetic instructions such as additions and multiplications.

### Data preparation

#### Missing data

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
DataExplorer::plot_missing(df,
                           geom_label_args = list(size = 2, label.padding = unit(0.2, "lines")))
```
#### Encoding of categorical data

```{r}
sex_df <- df %>%
  dplyr::select(SDC_sex)
```

```{python}
#| echo: fenced
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse = False)
sex_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(r.sex_df)
```

```{r}
df <- cbind(df,
            data.frame(py$sex_encoded)) %>% 
  dplyr::rename(sex_male = X1,
                sex_female = X2)
df %>%
  head(10) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

### Target classes

::: panel-tabset
#### :pencil2: Exercise 2

What are the different age categories available in the dataset and how many observations/samples of each types are there?

::: callout-tip
-   R: use `table`
-   Python: select the right column and use the `value_counts` method.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
# Write your code here
```

#### R

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
table(df$SDC_age_category)
```
:::

### Feature distribution

::: panel-tabset
#### :pencil2: Exercise 3

Let us now look at the distribution of individual features, to get more insights about the data.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
# Write your code here
```

#### R

We can start by plotting histograms, note that this only works for features containing numerical values

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
df %>%  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = MEAS_height_in_cm,
                            fill = SDC_age_category)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2, alpha = 0.5, position = "identity") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
df %>%  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = MEAS_weight_in_kg,
                            fill = SDC_age_category)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, alpha = 0.5, position = "identity") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Python

```{python}
#| echo: fenced
import seaborn
import matplotlib.pyplot
pairplot_figure = seaborn.pairplot(r.df, hue = "SDC_age_category")
matplotlib.pyplot.show()
```

:::

::: panel-tabset
### :pencil2: Exercise 3

Show variable/feature distribution for each age category.

Looking at these distributions, how hard do you think it will be to classify the age category only using height and weight?

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
# Write your code here
```

Looking at the previous scatter-plot showing height and weight, the age categories are reasonably well separated.

There is some small overlap between the age categories, so we can expect a statistical model to perform well on this dataset but not perfectly.

### R

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
# Write your code here
```

## Train-test data split

When building a machine learning model, it is important to evaluate the trained model on data that was not used to fit it, as generalization is more than memorization (meaning we want a rule that generalizes to new data, without evaluating on data we memorized). The data used to fit a model is called **training** data.

Correct evaluation is easily done by leaving out a subset of the data when training the model and using it afterwards for model evaluation. The data used to assess a model is called **testing** data.

### Remove missing data

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
df <- df[!is.na(df$MEAS_height_in_cm), ]
df %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

### Generate the training / test sampling

Use a seed to make the sampling reproducible (i.e. the same sampling will be generated each time we run this code)

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
set.seed(1)
```

Create ID column

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
df$id <- 1:nrow(df)
```

Use 70% of dataset as training set and 30% as test set 

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
train_df <- df %>%
  dplyr::sample_frac(0.70)
test_df  <- dplyr::anti_join(df,
                             train_df,
                             by = 'id')
```

### Separate the data and the target

Create the target.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
train_target <- train_df["SDC_age_category"] 
test_target <- test_df["SDC_age_category"] 
```

Remove the target from the training and test dataset to create the data matrix.

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
train_data_matrix <- train_df %>%
  dplyr::select(-SDC_age_category,
                -SDC_age_in_months)
test_data_matrix <- test_df %>%
  dplyr::select(-SDC_age_category,
                -SDC_age_in_months)
```

## Train the classifier

Let us now use a nearest neighbour approach for learning the target from the training data matrix of weights and heights. The principle behind [**nearest neighbor methods**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.neighbors "sklearn.neighbors") is to find a predefined number of training samples closest in distance to the new point, and predict the label from these.

Despite its simplicity, nearest neighbors has been successful in a large number of classification and regression problems. Supervised neighbors-based learning comes in two flavors:
* [classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html#classification) for data with discrete labels
* [regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html#regression) for data with continuous labels.

```{python}
#| echo: fenced
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

model = KNeighborsClassifier()
_ = model.fit(r.train_data_matrix, r.train_target.values.ravel())
```

## Evaluate the performance of the classifier

```{python}
#| echo: fenced
target_predicted = model.predict(r.test_data_matrix)
```

Confusion matrix

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| df-print: kable
combined <- cbind(test_target, py$target_predicted)
colnames(combined) <- c("target", "prediction") 
combined <- combined %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(correct = 1 * (target == prediction))
combined %>%  head(5)
```

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
perf <- mean(combined$correct)
```

Number of correct prediction: `r perf`

```{python}
#| echo: fenced
accuracy = model.score(r.test_data_matrix, r.test_target)
model_name = model.__class__.__name__
```

The test accuracy using a `r py$model_name` is `r py$accuracy`.

:::callout-important
The score of a model will in general depend on the way we make the training / test split. 

* One downside of doing a single split is that it does not give any information about this variability.
* Another downside, in a setting where the amount of data is small, is that the data available for training and testing will be even smaller after splitting.
