title: "Getting started with Quarto"

## Introduction

While it makes sense to use Quarto going forward, there are still a lot of resources written for and in R Markdown. For this reason we provide the R Markdown equivalents for this section in Appendix.

## Installation

To use Quarto with R, you should install the **rmarkdown** R package.

::: callout-important
A R package is a collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format, created to add specific functionality to R.

There are 10,000+ user contributed packages and growing.

There is a set of standard (or base) packages which is considered part of the R source code and automatically available as part of your R installation. Base packages contain the basic functions that allow R to work, and enable standard statistical and graphical functions on data sets.

To install packages

```{{r}}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

Installation of the rmarkdown package will also install the knitr package so you will have everything required to render documents containing R code.

Quarto will select a version of R by looking on the system PATH. In addition, on Windows when R is not found on the PATH, the registry will be scanned for the current R version. You can override the version of R used by Quarto by setting the QUARTO_R environment variable.

## Create a new Quarto document

In RStudio, you can open a new Quarto document by selecting **File** \> **New File** \> **Quarto Document...**

When you create a new Quarto document, RStudio tries to be helpful by allowing you to select a template which explains the different section of an R Markdown script. R Studio will enable you select options to pick from to generate a template Quarto document to start from.

The title and the author names are not important. If the output document type you want is not one of these, do not worry - you can just pick any one and change it later.

Let us select *HTML* to create an html document.

Click on create to open up a new Quarto (.Qmd) document.

## Visual Editor

The RStudio Visual Editor is quite new and has features that improve your writing experience. Working in the Visual Editor feels a bit like working in a Google Doc.

Hereâ€™s an example showing the same file in the original Source Editor with content in markdown format and in the Visual Editor with content that looks more like it will appear in a live site. You can switch freely between these modes.

## Quarto document structure

An R Markdown document can be edited in RStudio.

There are three basic components to an Quarto document, similar to the components of a R Markdown document:

-   a YAML header
-   Markdown text
-   R code chunks

![](images/paste-30C30ECC.png) The header contain the information intended to produce an html output.

## Quarto render

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.

## Code options

You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
