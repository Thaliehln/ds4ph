# Preface {.unnumbered}

## Introduction

Data science and artificial intelligence have the potential to generate fundamentally new insights on global health policies in Africa, but the full realization of this potential depends on the availability of a critical mass of highly trained health data scientists on the continent.

This electronic book was originally created by Hélène Langet, Fenella Beynon, Silvia Cicconi and Gillian Levine from the [Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH)](https://www.swisstph.ch) and Samwel Lwambura from the [Ifakara Health Institute (IHI)](https://ihi.or.tz/) to accompany the **Data Science for Public Health** workshop which was held in Dar-es-Salaam from Monday,September 26th to Wednesday, September 28th 2022. The goal of this workshop was to enable IHI researchers to strengthen their expertise in the area and to lay the foundations for the development of a data science curriculum that is adapted to IHI's needs.

The content of this electronic book is currently being updated and restructured. This revision aims to incorporate some of the latest technical developments and to refine explanations of key reproducible research and data science concepts to better suit the needs of a graduate-level public health audience.
