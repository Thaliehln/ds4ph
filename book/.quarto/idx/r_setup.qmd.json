It is one of main programming language used for data science (with other programming languages such as Python and Julia).\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Step 1\n\nYou can download R from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) which is a network of servers around the world that store identical up-to-date versions of code and documentation for R.\n\n![](images/paste-13103C13.png)\n\nScroll down the page to locate the mirror that is the closest to your geographic location and click on its URL.\n\n::: callout-tip\nSelecting a mirror that is close to you may help speed up the download. You can still use another mirror since the closest geographic location does not always give the best mirror.\n:::\n\nFor instance, when downloading R from Tanzania, you can select the [mirror from South Africa](https://cran.mirror.ac.za/).\n\n### Step 2\n\nOnce on the CRAN page, select your operating system: Linux, macOS, or Windows.\n\n![](images/paste-23A4B16E.png)\n\n### Step 3\n\nSelect binaries for base distribution\n\n![](images/paste-0739A4C1.png)\n\n### Step 4\n\nDownload the R installer (\\< 80 MB)\n\n![](images/paste-9624855F.png){width=\"350\"}\n\n### Step 5\n\nIn your computer's Downloads folder, double-click the R setup file.\n\n![](images/paste-FD7C97A4.png)\n\n### Step 6\n\nFollow the instruction in the installation wizard to complete the installation.\n\n![](images/paste-0F242DBF.png)\n:::\n\n## Install and setup RStudio Desktop {#sec-RStudio-installation}\n\n**Rstudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that enables an easier use of R.\n\n::: callout-note\nRStudio is moving away from its R-exclusive focus and becoming [Posit](https://posit.co/) in October 2022 to enable broader data science, scientific research, and technical communication functionalities and, in particular, to integrate Python users.\n:::\n\n::: callout-important\nIn order for RStudio desktop to work with R you must have installed R on your computer, see @sec-R-installation. RStudio does not include R when you download and install it.\n:::\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Step 1\n\nYou can download R from the [RStudio website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
