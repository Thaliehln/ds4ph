The challenge here is not only that you have no idea which draft is actually the latest version of the document, but also that it is almost impossible to understand what decision on the document content was taken when.\n\n![\"Piled Higher and Deeper\" by Jorge Cham www.phdcomics.com](images/paste-2840AEE3.png){#fig-final-doc}\n\nVersion control is the process by which the development of a document is clearly identified. It provides huge benefits to organization, archiving, and being able to find your files easily when you need them. Git is a tool that\n\n### Learning objectives\n\nIn this chapter, we introduce the basic elements of version control. We will learn the terminology and practice version control on a *need-to-know* basis across the workshop.\n\n-   What is version control?\n\n-   What tools are available to support version control?\n\n-   How to set up Git version control for a project?\n\n## Version control\n\nVersion control generally applies at a level of a project. It tracks and manages different drafts and versions for each document in the project.\n\n::: callout-important\nWith version control, you will only see a single file, which is the most recent version (*final* version). This helps avoiding confusion.\n:::\n\nVersion control provides an audit trail for the revisions and updates of final versions.\n\n::: callout-tip\nVersion control tracks **what** changes have been made, **by whom** and **when**, so that you do no longer need to save a copy of your documents with your name or the date in the filename.\n:::\n\nVersion control allows you to discard recent updates and restore an earlier version of our project if needed.\n\n![This image was created by Scriberia for The Turing Way community and is used under a CC-BY licence.

Enter **data_science_workshop_sept_2022** as the name of your new repository.\n2.  Click **Choose...** to select the local directory in which your new repository will be created. Using Windows Explorer, navigate to the local repository of your choice.\n3.  Check **Initialize this repository with a README** to create a README file in your new repository. This is *optional* and you will be able to create a README file later if you wish to do so.\n4.
