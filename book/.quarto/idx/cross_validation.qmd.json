It consists of repeating the procedure such that the training and testing sets are different each time.\n\nGeneralization performance metrics are collected for each repetition and then aggregated. As a result we can assess the variability of our measure of the model's generalization performance.\n\nNote that there exists several cross-validation strategies, each of them defines how to repeat the `fit`/`score` procedure. In this section, we will use the K-fold strategy: the entire dataset is split into `K` partitions. The `fit`/`score` procedure is repeated `K` times where at each iteration `K - 1` partitions are used to fit the model and `1` partition is used to score.\n\n![K-fold strategy](https://inria.github.io/scikit-learn-mooc/_images/cross_validation_diagram.png){alt=\"Cross-validation diagram\"}\n\n::: callout-note\nThis figure shows the particular case of K-fold cross-validation strategy. For each cross-validation split, the procedure trains a clone of model on all the red samples and evaluate the score of the model on the blue samples. As mentioned earlier, there is a variety of different cross-validation strategies. Some of these aspects will be covered in more detail in future notebooks.\n:::\n\nCross-validation is therefore computationally intensive because it requires training several models instead of one.\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCross-validation allows us to:\n\n    a) train the model faster\n\n    b) measure the generalization performance of the model\n\n    c) reach better generalization performance\n\n    d) estimate the variability of the generalization score\n\nSelect all answers that apply\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"cross_validation.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","bibliography":["references.bib"],"csl":"vancouver.csl","theme":"cosmo","title":"Cross-validation"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"cross_validation.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"csl":"vancouver.csl","documentclass":"scrreprt","title":"Cross-validation"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
