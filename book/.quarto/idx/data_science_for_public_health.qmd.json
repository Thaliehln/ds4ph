The latter course present severe challenges as well as exciting opportunities. The former risks seeing statistics become increasingly marginal...</q> [@chambers93]\n\n**John Chambers** (PhD in Statistics) is the creator of the S programming language, and a core member of the R programming language project.\n\n### Quote 2 :speech_balloon:\n\n<q>Data science is the science of **learning from data**; it studies the methods involved in the analysis and processing of data and proposes technology to **improve methods in an evidence-based manner**. The scope and impact of this science will expand enormously in coming decades as scientific data and data about science itself become ubiquitously available.</q> [@donoho17].\n\n**David Donoho** is a Professor of Statistics at Stanford University.\n\n### Quote 1\n\n-   Growing field with computational power and data generation\n-   Set of collective evidence-based processes, theories, concepts, tools and technologies\n-   Extraction of valuable knowledge and information from data (learning from data)\n:::\n\nQualitative thinking currently does not receive nearly as much attention as quantitative thinking in data science.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Discussion :speech_balloon:\n\nWhat does Data Science mean for you?\n\n![](images/paste-AC41DECB.png)\n\n### From literature\n\nHad you thought of any of those words?

This process of generalizing from a sample to a population is inherently uncertain, because we haven't sampled everyone.\n\n![](images/paste-6D803DF2.png)\n\n**Our data come from a randomized experiment.** Historically, the tools of statistical inference have been designed to address concerns just like this.\n\n**We want to use our data to make a prediction about the future, and we expect the future to be similar to the past.**\n\n**Our observations are subject to measurement or reporting error.** Most measurements are subject to at least some kind of error, and sometimes those errors are large enough to matter.\n\n**Our data arise from an intrinsically random or variable process.**\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"data_science_for_public_health.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","bibliography":["references.bib"],"csl":"vancouver.csl","theme":"cosmo","title":":books: Data Science for Public Health"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"data_science_for_public_health.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"csl":"vancouver.csl","documentclass":"scrreprt","title":":books: Data Science for Public Health"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
