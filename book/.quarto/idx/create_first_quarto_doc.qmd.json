Familairise with RStudio\n2. Get set up with not storing the RStudio workspace\n3. Learn how to use Quarto\n\n## Orientation to the RStudio interface\n\nOpen RStudio\n\nBy default RStudio displays four rectangle panes.\n\n::: callout-tip\nIf your RStudio displays only one left pane it is because you have no scripts open yet.\n:::\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### R Console Pane\n\nThe R Console, by default the left or lower-left pane in R Studio, is the home of the R \"engine\". This is where the commands are actually run and non-graphic outputs and error/warning messages appear. You can directly enter and run commands in the R Console, but realize that these commands are not saved as they are when running commands from a script.\n\n::: callout-note\nThis pane is similar to the Stata Command and the Results windows.\n:::\n\n### Source Pane\n\nThis pane, by default in the upper-left, is space to edit and run your scripts, including the RMarkdown outbreak and survey templates. This pane can also display datasets (data frames) for viewing.\n\n::: callout-note\nThis pane is similar to the Stata Do-file and Data Editor windows.\n:::\n\n### Environment Pane\n\nThis pane, by default the upper-right, is most often used to see brief summaries of objects in the R Environment in the current session. These objects could include imported, modified, or created datasets, parameters you have defined (e.g. a specific epi week for the analysis), or vectors or lists you have defined during analysis (e.g. names of regions). Click on the arrow next to a dataframe name to see its variables.\n\n::: callout-note\nThis pane is similar to the Stata Variables Manager window.\n:::\n\n### Lower-right pane\n\nThe lower-right pane includes several tabs:\n\n-   Files (library of files)\n-   Plots (display of graphics including maps)\n-   Packages (available R packages including installation/update options)\n-   Help\n-   Viewer\n-   Presentation.\n\n::: callout-note\nThis pane contains the Stata equivalents of the Plots Manager and Project Manager windows.\n:::\n:::\n\n### RStudio setup\n\nTo first get set up, I highly recommend changing the following setting\n\nTools > Global Options (or Cmd + , on macOS)\n\nUnder the General tab:\n\n    For workspace\n        Uncheck restore .RData into workspace at startup\n        Save workspace to .RData on exit : “Never”\n    For History\n        Uncheck “Always save history (even when not saving .RData)\n        Uncheck “Remove duplicate entries in history”\n\n## Open a new R project\n\nIn RStudio, you can create a new project by selecting **File** \\> **New Project...**\n\n![](images/paste-CCA1D5A5.png){width=\"350\"}\n\nSelect New Directory\n\n![](images/paste-DCC39BB5.png)\n\nSelect New Project\n\n![](images/paste-30A4402B.png)\n\nSelect a location to save the new R project (this creates a new folder).\n\n![](images/paste-C05F97BD.png){width=\"500\"}\n\nSave all relevant data files into this new R project folder.\n\nWe will use this project for the duration of the workshop.\n\n## Create a new Quarto document\n\nWhile it makes sense to use Quarto going forward, there are still a lot of resources written for and in R Markdown. For this reason we provide the R Markdown equivalents for this section in Appendix.\n\nIn RStudio, you can create a new Quarto document by selecting **File** \\> **New File** \\> **Quarto Document...**\n\n![](images/paste-A7DE8B60.png)\n\nWhen you create a new Quarto document, RStudio tries to be helpful by allowing you to select a template which explains the different section of an R Markdown script. R Studio will enable you select options to pick from to generate a template Quarto document to start from.\n\nThe title and the author names are not important. If the output document type you want is not one of these, do not worry - you can just pick any one and change it later.\n\nLet us select *HTML* to create an html document.\n\nClick on create to open up a new Quarto (.Qmd) document.\n\n![](images/paste-67B97E04.png)\n\n## Visual Editor\n\nThe RStudio Visual Editor is quite new and has features that improve your writing experience. Working in the Visual Editor feels a bit like working in a Google Doc.\n\nHere's an example showing the same file in the original Source Editor with content in markdown format and in the Visual Editor with content that looks more like it will appear in a live site. You can switch freely between these modes.\n\n## Quarto document structure\n\nAn R Markdown document can be edited in RStudio.\n\nThere are three basic components to a Quarto document, similar to the components of a R Markdown document:\n\n-   metadata (YAML header)\n-   text (markdown formatting)\n-   code (R code formatting)\n\n![](images/paste-30C30ECC.png)\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### YAML header\n\nThe very top of the document consists of a (YAML) header surrounded by --- lines. Here you may want to edit the title of your document. The other settings in the header define the default document type produced (Microsoft Word) when the RMarkdown is \"knit\". the information intended to produce an html output.\n\n### Text\n\nIn WHITE background areas, any text will appear as regular text in the final report. Can have formatting such as headings, italics, bold, numbers, and bullets. See the second page of this RMarkdown cheatsheet for more detail. Can display parameters derived from your data via in-line code (such as epi week of the outbreak peak, as in the example above).\n\n### Code chunks\n\nIn gray background \"code chunks\", RMarkdown is running R commands. These commands perform data processing and cleaning steps, or could produce visual outputs in the document.\n:::\n\n## Quarto render\n\nWhen you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.\n\n![](images/paste-A8386DC4.png) \\## Code options\n\nYou can embed code like this:\n\n```{r}\n1 + 1\n```\n\nYou can add options to executable code like this\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n2 * 2\n```\n\nThe `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).\n\n## References\n\n-   The Epidemiologist R Handbook (https://epirhandbook.com)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"create_first_quarto_doc.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","bibliography":["references.bib"],"csl":"vancouver.csl","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":":blue_book: Getting started with Quarto"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"create_first_quarto_doc.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"csl":"vancouver.csl","editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt","title":":blue_book: Getting started with Quarto"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
