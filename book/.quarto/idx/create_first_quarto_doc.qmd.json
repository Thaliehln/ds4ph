For this reason we provide the R Markdown equivalents for this section in Appendix.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use Quarto with R, you should install the **rmarkdown** R package.\n\n::: callout-important\nA R package is a collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format, created to add specific functionality to R.\n\nThere are 10,000+ user contributed packages and growing.\n\nThere is a set of standard (or base) packages which is considered part of the R source code and automatically available as part of your R installation. Base packages contain the basic functions that allow R to work, and enable standard statistical and graphical functions on data sets.\n:::\n\nTo install packages\n\n```{{r}}\ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\n```\n\nInstallation of the rmarkdown package will also install the knitr package so you will have everything required to render documents containing R code.\n\nQuarto will select a version of R by looking on the system PATH. In addition, on Windows when R is not found on the PATH, the registry will be scanned for the current R version. You can override the version of R used by Quarto by setting the QUARTO_R environment variable.\n\n## Create a new Quarto document\n\nIn RStudio, you can open a new Quarto document by selecting **File** \\> **New File** \\> **Quarto Document...**\n\n![](images/paste-A7DE8B60.png)\n\nWhen you create a new Quarto document, RStudio tries to be helpful by allowing you to select a template which explains the different section of an R Markdown script. R Studio will enable you select options to pick from to generate a template Quarto document to start from.\n\nThe title and the author names are not important. If the output document type you want is not one of these, do not worry - you can just pick any one and change it later.\n\nLet us select *HTML* to create an html document.\n\nClick on create to open up a new Quarto (.Qmd) document.\n\n![](images/paste-67B97E04.png)\n\n## Visual Editor\n\nThe RStudio Visual Editor is quite new and has features that improve your writing experience. Working in the Visual Editor feels a bit like working in a Google Doc.\n\nHereâ€™s an example showing the same file in the original Source Editor with content in markdown format and in the Visual Editor with content that looks more like it will appear in a live site. You can switch freely between these modes.\n\n## Quarto document structure\n\nAn R Markdown document can be edited in RStudio.\n\nThere are three basic components to an Quarto document, similar to the components of a R Markdown document:\n\n-   a YAML header\n-   Markdown text\n-   R code chunks\n\n![](images/paste-30C30ECC.png) The header contain the information intended to produce an html output.\n\n## Quarto render\n\nWhen you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.\n\n![](images/paste-A8386DC4.png)\n\n## Code options\n\nYou can embed code like this:\n\n```{r}\n1 + 1\n```\n\nYou can add options to executable code like this\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\n2 * 2\n```\n\nThe `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).\n\n## References\n\n-   The Epidemiologist R Handbook (https://epirhandbook.com)\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"create_first_quarto_doc.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"Getting started with Quarto"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"create_first_quarto_doc.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt","title":"Getting started with Quarto"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
