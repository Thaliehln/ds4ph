Given the deterministic nature of computer programmes, a quantitative analysis must be reproducible to be **credible**.\n\n![This image was created by Scriberia for The Turing Way community and is used under a CC-BY licence.

How do you think reproducible quantitative analyses can improve your research?\n2.  Recent investigations have shown that a significant percentage of scientific studies cannot be reproduced, thus contributing to growing mistrust in scientific results [@baker_scientists_2016; @harris_use_2018].

Quantitative analyses can often not be fully reproduced because of complexities in how software tools are packaged, installed, and executed and because of limitations associated with how scientists document analysis steps.\n\n![](images/phd_comics_code_documentation.png)\n:::\n\n## Software tools across the research data lifecycle\n\nAs illustrated in @fig-software-tools-across-research-lifecycle, there is now a whole set of free or open source software tools that are available to help you automate your processes and overcome reproducibility challenges across the research data lifecycle.\n\nIn this workshop, you will be introduced to following software tools that will help make your quantitative data processing, study and analysis more reproducible:\n\n-   **Git/GitHub** allow you to keep track of various versions of your code, share your code and collaborate with others on code development;\n-   **R** is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics and one of main programming language used for data science (with other programming languages such as **Python** and Julia). The ecosystem around R provides an interactive environment for data science science workflows, thus making R is a great start for your data science journey.\n-   **Rstudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that enables an easier use of R.\n-   **Quarto** allow you to generate (reproducible) dynamic reports to document your data analyses. We will use Quarto within the **R/RStudio** environment.\n\n:::callout-important\nIn practice, most data scientists use a mix of languages, often at least R and Python. You will be slightly exposed to R, but the goal of this workshop is\n:::\n\n![Example of free / open source software tools across the research data lifecycle.
