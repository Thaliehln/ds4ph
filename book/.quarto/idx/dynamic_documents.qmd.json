It can generate static or interactive outputs, in Word, pdf, html, powerpoint, and other formats. The next generation Quarto\n\nAs a R Markdown document, a Quarto document intersperces code and text such that the script actually becomes your output document. You can create an entire formatted document, including narrative text (can be dynamic to change based on your data), tables, figures, bullets/numbers, bibliographies, etc.\n\nSuch documents can be produced to update on a routine basis (e.g. daily surveillance reports) and/or run on subsets of data (e.g. reports for each jurisdiction).\n\nBackground to R Markdown\n\nTo explain some of the concepts and packages involved:\n\n::: callout-note\nMarkdown is a “language” that allows you to write a document using plain text, that can be converted to html and other formats. It is not specific to R. Files written in Markdown have a ‘.md’ extension.\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\nR Markdown: is a variation on markdown that is specific to R - it allows you to write a document using markdown to produce text and to embed R code and display their outputs. R Markdown files have ‘.Rmd’ extension.\n:::\n\nrmarkdown - the package: This is used by R to render the .Rmd file into the desired output. It’s focus is converting the markdown (text) syntax, so we also need…\n\nknitr: This R package will read the code chunks, execute it, and ‘knit’ it back into the document. This is how tables and graphs are included alongside the text.\n\nPandoc: Finally, pandoc actually convert the output into word/pdf/powerpoint etc. It is a software separate from R but is installed automatically with RStudio.\n\nIn sum, the process that happens in the background involves feeding the .Rmd file to knitr, which executes the R code chunks and creates a new .md (markdown) file which includes the R code and its rendered output. The .md file is then processed by pandoc to create the finished product: a Microsoft Word document, HTML file, powerpoint document, pdf, etc.\n\nQuarto integrates code and natural language in a way that is called “literate programming” (Knuth 1984). It is the successor to R Markdown, which was a variant of Markdown specifically designed to allow R code chunks to be included. Quatro uses a mark-up language similar to HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or LaTeX, in comparison to a “What You See Is What You Get” (WYSIWYG) language, such as Microsoft Word. This means that all the aspects are consistent, for instance, all top-level heading will look the same. But it means that we use symbols to designate how we would like certain aspects to appear. And it is only when we build the mark-up that we get to see what it looks like. A visual editor option can also be used which hides the need for the user to do this mark-up themselves.\n\nWhile it makes sense to use Quarto going forward, there are still a lot of resources written for and in R Markdown. For this reason we provide the R Markdown equivalents for this section in Appendix B.\n\n\n* The Epidemiologist R Handbook (https://epirhandbook.com)"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"dynamic_documents.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.37","bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"Dynamic documents"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"dynamic_documents.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt","title":"Dynamic documents"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
