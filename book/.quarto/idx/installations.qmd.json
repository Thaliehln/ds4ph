You can still use another mirror since the closest geographic location does not always give the best mirror.\n:::\n\nFor instance, when downloading R from Tanzania, you can select the [mirror from South Africa](https://cran.mirror.ac.za/).\n\n### Step 2\n\nOnce on the CRAN page, select your operating system: Linux, macOS, or Windows.\n\n![](images/paste-23A4B16E.png)\n\n### Step 3\n\nSelect binaries for base distribution\n\n![](images/paste-0739A4C1.png)\n\n### Step 4\n\nDownload the installer\n\n![](images/paste-9624855F.png){width=\"350\"}\n\n![](images/paste-C42ACB10.png){width=\"350\"}\n\n### Step 5\n\nAfter downloading the installer, follow the installation wizard on your computer.\n:::\n\n## Install RStudio Desktop {#sec-RStudio-installation}\n\nRstudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R that enables an easier use of R.\n\n::: callout-important\nIn order for RStudio desktop to work with R you must have installed R on your computer, see @sec-R-installation. RStudio does not include R when you download and install it.\n:::\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Step 1\n\nThere are different products, but the free Desktop version is just perfect for our needs.\n\n### Step 2\n\nDownload the [installer](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/windows/RStudio-2022.07.1-554.exe):\n\n### Step 3\n\nAfter downloading the installer, follow the installation wizard on your computer.\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\nRStudio is moving away from its R-exclusive focus and becoming [Posit](https://posit.co/) in October 2022 to enable broader data science, scientific research, and technical communication functionalities and, in particular, to integrate Python users.\n:::\n\n## Install Quarto\n\nTo install Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/.\n\nAfter downloading, follow the installation wizard on your computer.\n\n![](images/paste-FE57875E.png)\n\nWhen the installation is complete, you will not see any new software on your laptop, but Quarto is now available to be used in RStudio, as well as by all other applications on your computer (including the command line).\n\nTo use Quarto with R, you should install the **rmarkdown** R package.\n\n::: callout-important\nA R package is a collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format, created to add specific functionality to R.\n\nThere are 10,000+ user contributed packages and growing.\n\nThere is a set of standard (or base) packages which is considered part of the R source code and automatically available as part of your R installation. Base packages contain the basic functions that allow R to work, and enable standard statistical and graphical functions on data sets.\n:::\n\nTo install packages\n\n```{{r}}\ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\n```\n\nInstallation of the rmarkdown package will also install the knitr package so you will have everything required to render documents containing R code.\n\nQuarto will select a version of R by looking on the system PATH. In addition, on Windows when R is not found on the PATH, the registry will be scanned for the current R version. You can override the version of R used by Quarto by setting the QUARTO_R environment variable.\n\n## GitHub account\n\nGitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. To Create a github account: [sign up](https://github.com/signup \"Github account creation\")\n\n## GitHub desktop\n\n::: callout-important\n**You must have Git installed before using GitHub Desktop**.\n:::\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Step 1\n\nDownload and install the latest version of Git from [link](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n\n## Step 2\n\nDownload github desktop installer from [link](https://desktop.github.com/), After downloading, follow the installation wizard on your computer\n:::\n\n### How to connect your GitHub account to GitHub Desktop?\n\n#### Authenticating to GitHub\n\nTo connect to GitHub Desktop with GitHub, you will need to authenticate your GitHub account.\n\n1.  Use the File menu, then click Options.\n2.  In the Options window, select Accounts.\n3.  To the right of \"GitHub.com,\" click Sign in.\n4.  In the \"Sign in Using Your Browser\" pane, click Continue With Browser. GitHub Desktop will open your default browser.\n5.  To authenticate to GitHub, type your GitHub.com credentials and click Sign in. Alternatively, if you were already signed in to GitHub, follow the prompts to return to GitHub Desktop to finish authenticating.\n6.  After GitHub authenticates your account, follow the prompts to return to GitHub Desktop.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"installations.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","bibliography":["references.bib"],"csl":"vancouver.csl","editor":"visual","theme":"cosmo","title":"Install software"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","from":"markdown+emoji","output-file":"installations.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"csl":"vancouver.csl","editor":"visual","documentclass":"scrreprt","title":"Install software"},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
