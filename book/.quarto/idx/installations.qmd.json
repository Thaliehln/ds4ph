You can still use another mirror since the closest geographic location does not always give the best mirror.\n:::\n\nFor instance, when downloading R from Tanzania, you can select the [mirror from South Africa](https://cran.mirror.ac.za/).\n\n### Step 2\n\nOnce on the CRAN page, select your operating system: Linux, macOS, or Windows.\n\n![](images/paste-23A4B16E.png)\n\n### Step 3\n\nSelect binaries for base distribution\n\n![](images/paste-0739A4C1.png)\n\n### Step 4\n\nDownload the installer\n\n![](images/paste-9624855F.png){width=\"350\"}\n\n![](images/paste-C42ACB10.png){width=\"350\"}\n\n### Step 5\n\nAfter downloading the installer, follow the installation wizard on your computer.\n\n:::\n\n## Install RStudio\n\nRstudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. \n\n::: callout-important\nRStudio does include R when you download and install it, so you need to have installed R to be able to use RStudio with R (see Section @sec-R-installation).\n:::\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### Step 1\n\nThere are different products, but the free Desktop version is just perfect for our needs.\n\n### Step 2\n\nDownload the [installer](https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/windows/RStudio-2022.07.1-554.exe): \n\n### Step 5\n\nAfter downloading the installer, follow the installation wizard on your computer.\n\n:::\n\n::: callout-note\nRStudio is moving away from its R-exclusive focus and becoming [Posit](https://posit.co/) in October 2022 to enable broader data science, scientific research, and technical communication functionalities and, in particular, to integrate Python users.\n:::\n\n## Install Quarto\n\nTo install Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/.\n\nAfter downloading, follow the installation wizard on your computer.\n\n![](images/paste-FE57875E.png)\n\nWhen the installation is complete, you will not see any new software on your laptop, but Quarto is now available to be used in RStudio, as well as by all other applications on your computer (including the command line).\n\n## GitHub account\n\n## GitHub desktop\n\nTo install GitHub Desktop: link.
