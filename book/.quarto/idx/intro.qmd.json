The goal of this project is to jointly develop and implement a public health data science curriculum to enable researchers from the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) in Tanzania to strengthen their expertise in the area.\n\n## Learning objectives\n\nTwo complementary aspects of moving into data science are:\n\n1. the mindset about how scientists think and collaborate about data, and\n2. the skillsets which is composed of an ecosystem of tools (mostly open-source) and practices.\n\nUpon completing the workshop, participants will have gained:\n\n* exposure to data science approach, tools and collaborative practices\n* hands-on experience on how to interface between Stata and R, learned the basics of working with data in R/RStudio, and how to incrementally incorporate R into your existing data analysis workflows in Stata. The idea is not to replace everything you do in Stata into R but that you can continue your learning after this workshop at your own pace.\n\n## Is this workshop for me?\n\nThis workshop is relevant for individuals who answer yes to the following questions:\n\n- [ ] Do you who want to develop data science projects in public health?\n- [ ] Do you wants to learn more about how open and reproducible science approaches can be used in your daily practice?\n- [ ] Are you a Stata user (or any other data analysis language) who would like to expand your data analysis skillset with R?\n- [ ] Do you want to bridge analyses between data analysis tools (Stata, R or Python) and to more easily collaborate with other researchers who use another of these tools? \n\n## Schedule\n\n|Time (group)      |      Day 1 (stream 1)|      Day 1 (stream 2)|      Day 2 (stream 1)|      Day 2 (stream 2)|\n|:----------|----------:|----------:|----------:|----------:|\n|8:30-9:00    |  Welcome | Welcome | Welcome | Welcome |\n|9:00-10:30    |  Data science introduction |  Data science introduction | Sharing | Sharing |\n|Break      |  | | | |\n|11:00-11:30    |  Introduction to Git |   Introduction to Git  | | |\n|11.30-13:00   | Public Health question (need) | Public Health question (data strategy) | TBD  | Machine learning analysis |\n|Lunch break      |  || | |\n|14:00-15:30 | Analysis Plan | R, RStudio and RMarkdown | Sharing | Sharing |\n|Break      |  | | | |\n|16:00-17:30 | N/A | ODK Central API, ruODK | Wrap-up | Wrap-up |\n\nThis project aims to accompany researchers to progress on the following development axes:\n\n* Data science mindset\n    * [Use of reproducible research practices in public health](https://github.com/Thaliehln/ds4ph/wiki/1.-Use-of-reproducible-research-practices-in-public-health)\n    * Data provenance\n        * Use of distinct data sources for the development of public health indicators\n        * Research data vs. real world evidence data\n    * Ethical data science\n    * Data papers\n* Data science skillset\n    * Programming tools\n        * [Move from Stata to R](https://github.com/Thaliehln/ds4ph/wiki/Moving-from-Stata-to-R) (prerequisite: Stata)\n        * R programming\n            * dplyr\n        * Python programming\n            * pandas\n            * scikit-learn (prerequisite: independent Python user)\n    * Coding with best practices (R/RStudio/tidyverse)\n        * Versioning using GitHub (all)\n        * Using targets (prerequisite: independent R user)\n    * Reporting and publishing: Dynamic report generation\n        * Using Stata (prerequisite: Stata)\n        * Using R/Rmarkdown (prerequisite: R basics)\n        * Notebooks (Python Jupyter Notebook, Rmarkdown as a notebook - prerequisite: Python/R basics)\n    * Reproducible data\n        * Use APIs (prerequisite: IT programming basics)\n        * Open access data (all)\n    * Statistical methods for reproducible research (advanced)\n\n### Wrap-up \n\nWhat is not covered\n\n* Reproducible workflows (targets)\n* Reproducible environments (Binder, Docker, renv, etc)\n\n## Instructors\n\n### From the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI)\n\n* Samwel Lwambura\n* Hajirani Msuya\n* Ibrahim Mtebene\n* Charles Festo\n\n### From the Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH)\n\n* Fenella Beynon\n* Hélène Langet\n* Silvia Cicconi\n* Gillian Levine\n* Fabian Schär\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nSoon - here guidance to install the (free) software to be used in the workshop will be given.\n\n### R installation\n\n### RStudio installation\n\n### GitHub account\n\n### GitHub desktop\n\n## Data\n\nSoon - here a succinct description of the data to be used as part of the workshop will be given.\n\n-----\n\n![](https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png) This work is licensed under a [Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n\nYou are free to:\n\n* Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format\n* Adapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially. \n\n\nUnder the following terms:\n\n* Attribution — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.
