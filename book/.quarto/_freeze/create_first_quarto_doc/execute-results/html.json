    "markdown": "# Create your first Quarto document\n\n## Installation\n\nTo use Quarto with R, you should install the rmarkdown R package:\n\ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\n\nInstallation of the rmarkdown package will also install the knitr package so you will have everything required to render documents containing R code.\n\nQuarto will select a version of R by looking on the system PATH. In addition, on Windows when R is not found on the PATH, the registry will be scanned for the current R version. You can override the version of R used by Quarto by setting the QUARTO_R environment variable.\n\n## Create a new Quarto document\n\nIn RStudio, you can open a new Quarto document by selecting **File** \\> **New File** \\> **Quarto Document...**\n\n![](images/paste-A7DE8B60.png)\n\nWhen you create a new Quarto document, RStudio tries to be helpful by allowing you to select a template which explains the different section of an R Markdown script. R Studio will enable you select options to pick from to generate a template Quarto document to start from.\n\nThe title and the author names are not important. If the output document type you want is not one of these, do not worry - you can just pick any one and change it later.\n\nLet us select *HTML* to create an html document.\n\nClick on create to open up a new Quarto (.Qmd) document.\n\n![](images/paste-67B97E04.png)\n\n## Visual Editor\n\nThe RStudio Visual Editor is quite new and has features that improve your writing experience. Working in the Visual Editor feels a bit like working in a Google Doc.\n\nHereâ€™s an example showing the same file in the original Source Editor with content in markdown format and in the Visual Editor with content that looks more like it will appear in a live site. You can switch freely between these modes.\n\n## Quarto document structure\n\nAn R Markdown document can be edited in RStudio.\n\nThere are three basic components to an Quarto document, similar to the components of a R Markdown document:\n\n-   a YAML header\n-   Markdown text\n-   R code chunks\n\n![](images/paste-30C30ECC.png) The header contain the information intended to produce an html output.\n\n## Quarto render\n\nWhen you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.\n\n![](images/paste-A8386DC4.png)\n\n## Code options\n\nYou can embed code like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can add options to executable code like this\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 4\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).\n\n## References\n\n-   The Epidemiologist R Handbook (https://epirhandbook.com)\n",
