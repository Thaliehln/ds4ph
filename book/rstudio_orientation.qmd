## Introduction

### Overview

Please review the following sections for instructions on installation steps:

-   Downloading R (@sec-R-installation)
-   Downloading and configuring RStudio (@sec-RStudio-installation)

### Learning objectives

1. Familiarise with RStudio
2. Get set up with not storing the RStudio workspace

## Orientation to the RStudio interface

Open RStudio

By default RStudio displays four rectangle panes.

::: callout-tip
If your RStudio displays only one left pane it is because you have no scripts open yet.

::: panel-tabset
### R Console Pane

The R Console, by default the left or lower-left pane in R Studio, is the home of the R "engine". This is where the commands are actually run and non-graphic outputs and error/warning messages appear. You can directly enter and run commands in the R Console, but realize that these commands are not saved as they are when running commands from a script.

::: callout-tip
This pane is similar to the Stata Command and the Results windows.

### Source Pane

This pane, by default in the upper-left, is space to edit and run your scripts, including the RMarkdown outbreak and survey templates. This pane can also display datasets (data frames) for viewing.

::: callout-tip
This pane is similar to the Stata Do-file and Data Editor windows.
:::

### Environment Pane

This pane, by default the upper-right, is most often used to see brief summaries of objects in the R Environment in the current session. These objects could include imported, modified, or created datasets, parameters you have defined (e.g. a specific epi week for the analysis), or vectors or lists you have defined during analysis (e.g. names of regions). Click on the arrow next to a dataframe name to see its variables.

::: callout-tip
This pane is similar to the Stata Variables Manager window.
:::

### Lower-right pane

The lower-right pane includes several tabs:

-   Files (library of files)
-   Plots (display of graphics including maps)
-   Packages (available R packages including installation/update options)
-   Help
-   Viewer
-   Presentation.

::: callout-tip
This pane contains the Stata equivalents of the Plots Manager and Project Manager windows.

## Open a new R project

In RStudio, you can create a new project by selecting **File** \> **New Project...**

Select New Project

Select a location to save the new R project (this creates a new folder).

Save all relevant data files into this new R project folder.

We will use this project for the duration of the workshop.
