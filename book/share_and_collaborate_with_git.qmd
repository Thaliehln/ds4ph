## Introduction

## Sharing your code with Git

Even if we do not take advantage of the advanced and powerful version control functionality, we can still use Git and GitHub to share our code.

## Collaborating with Git

Once you set up a central repository, you can have multiple people make changes to code and keep versions synced. GitHub provides a free service for centralized repositories. GitHub also has a special utility, called a pull request, that can be used by anybody to suggest changes to your code. You can easily either accept or deny the request.
