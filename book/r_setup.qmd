Scroll down the page to locate the mirror that is the closest to your geographic location and click on its URL.

::: callout-tip
Selecting a mirror that is close to you may help speed up the download. You can still use another mirror since the closest geographic location does not always give the best mirror.
:::

For instance, when downloading R from Tanzania, you can select the [mirror from South Africa](https://cran.mirror.ac.za/).

### Step 2

Once on the CRAN page, select your operating system: Linux, macOS, or Windows.
