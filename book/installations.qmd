Scroll down the page to locate the mirror that is the closest to your geographic location and click on its URL.

::: callout-tip
Selecting a mirror that is close to you may help speed up the download. You can still use another mirror since the closest geographic location does not always give the best mirror.

For instance, when downloading R from Tanzania, you can select the [mirror from South Africa](https://cran.mirror.ac.za/).

### Step 2

Once on the CRAN page, select your operating system: Linux, macOS, or Windows.

A R package is a collections of R functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format, created to add specific functionality to R.

There are 10,000+ user contributed packages and growing.

There is a set of standard (or base) packages which is considered part of the R source code and automatically available as part of your R installation. Base packages contain the basic functions that allow R to work, and enable standard statistical and graphical functions on data sets.

To install packages

```{{r}}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

Installation of the rmarkdown package will also install the knitr package so you will have everything required to render documents containing R code.

Quarto will select a version of R by looking on the system PATH. In addition, on Windows when R is not found on the PATH, the registry will be scanned for the current R version. You can override the version of R used by Quarto by setting the QUARTO_R environment variable.
