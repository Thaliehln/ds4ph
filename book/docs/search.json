    "text": "The final product of a data analysis project is often a report. Many scientific publications can be thought of as a final report of a data analysis. The same is true for news articles based on data, an analysis report for your company, or lecture notes for a class on how to analyze data. The reports are often on paper or in a PDF that includes a textual description of the findings along with some figures and tables resulting from the analysis.\nImagine that after you finish the analysis and the report, you are told that you were given the wrong data set, you are sent a new one and you are asked to run the same analysis with this new data set. Or what if you realize that a mistake was made and need to re-examine the code, fix the error, and re-run the analysis? Or imagine that someone you are training wants to see the code and be able to reproduce the results to learn about your approach?\nSituations like the ones just described are actually quite common for a data scientist. Here, we describe how you can keep your data science projects organized with RStudio so that re-running an analysis is straight-forward. We then demonstrate how to generate reproducible reports with R markdown and the knitR package in a way that will greatly help with recreating reports with minimal work. This is possible due to the fact that R markdown documents permit code and textual descriptions to be combined into the same document, and the figures and tables produced by the code are automatically added to the document.\nR Markdown is a widely-used tool for creating automated, reproducible, and share-worthy outputs, such as reports. It can generate static or interactive outputs, in Word, pdf, html, powerpoint, and other formats. The next generation Quarto\nAs a R Markdown document, a Quarto document intersperces code and text such that the script actually becomes your output document. You can create an entire formatted document, including narrative text (can be dynamic to change based on your data), tables, figures, bullets/numbers, bibliographies, etc.\nSuch documents can be produced to update on a routine basis (e.g. daily surveillance reports) and/or run on subsets of data (e.g. reports for each jurisdiction)."

    "text": "3.2 Background to R Markdown\nTo explain some of the concepts and packages involved:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMarkdown is a “language” that allows you to write a document using plain text, that can be converted to html and other formats. It is not specific to R. Files written in Markdown have a ‘.md’ extension.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nR Markdown: is a variation on markdown that is specific to R - it allows you to write a document using markdown to produce text and to embed R code and display their outputs. R Markdown files have ‘.Rmd’ extension.\n\n\nrmarkdown - the package: This is used by R to render the .Rmd file into the desired output. It’s focus is converting the markdown (text) syntax, so we also need…\nknitr: This R package will read the code chunks, execute it, and ‘knit’ it back into the document. This is how tables and graphs are included alongside the text.\nPandoc: Finally, pandoc actually convert the output into word/pdf/powerpoint etc. It is a software separate from R but is installed automatically with RStudio.\nIn sum, the process that happens in the background involves feeding the .Rmd file to knitr, which executes the R code chunks and creates a new .md (markdown) file which includes the R code and its rendered output. The .md file is then processed by pandoc to create the finished product: a Microsoft Word document, HTML file, powerpoint document, pdf, etc.\nQuarto integrates code and natural language in a way that is called “literate programming” (Knuth 1984). It is the successor to R Markdown, which was a variant of Markdown specifically designed to allow R code chunks to be included. Quatro uses a mark-up language similar to HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or LaTeX, in comparison to a “What You See Is What You Get” (WYSIWYG) language, such as Microsoft Word. This means that all the aspects are consistent, for instance, all top-level heading will look the same. But it means that we use symbols to designate how we would like certain aspects to appear. And it is only when we build the mark-up that we get to see what it looks like. A visual editor option can also be used which hides the need for the user to do this mark-up themselves.\nQuarto is not tied to the R language."

To use Stata within Quarto, you have to use the RStata package, which is a simple R / Stata interface that enables you to:\n\nexecute Stata commands (inline or from a .do file) from R;\npass a data.frame to Stata;\nreturn a data.frame to R;\ninclude Stata chunks in knitr documents (however each chunk is independent from the others; feature tested with LaTeX/Linux).\n\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(RStata)\n```\n\n\n5.4.1 Configure RStudio to execute Stata\n\n5.4.1.1 Find your Stata binary path\nThe function chooseStataBin from the RStata library allows you to browse and set the path to your Stata binary executable.\n```{r}\nstata_bin_path <- RStata::chooseStataBin()\nprint(stata_bin_path)\n```\nWhen you run this code, you should normally get a path which is of the format: “\"C:\\Program Files\\Stata16\\StataIC-64\"”. Note that the .exe extension has been removed from this path. It is important that you keep the format as is, as otherwise your Stata engine will not be recognised.\n\n\n5.4.1.2 Add your Stata binary path to your .Rprofile\nThe Stata binary path setting we just created is just for your current RStudio session and it will be lost once your RStudio is closed. To keep this setting each time you are using RStudio and avoid havin to reconfigure RStata each time you are restarting RStudio, let us add the Stata binary path as an option to .Rprofile, which is your user-specific R configuration file.\n\nlibrary(usethis)\n\nWarning: Paket 'usethis' wurde unter R Version 4.1.3 erstellt\n\n\nUsethis is a workflow package: it automates repetitive tasks that arise during project setup and development, both for R packages and non-package projects.\nThe function edit_r_profile from the usethis library allows to open your configuration file .Rprofile.\n```{r}\nusethis::edit_r_profile(\"user\")\n```\nAdd the following two lines in the Rprofile file that you have just opened:\n\noptions(“RStata.StataPath” = …)\noptions(“RStata.StataVersion” = …)\n\nYou need to indicate the path to your Stata binary executable in the RStata.StataPath option (e.g., “\"C:\\Program Files\\Stata16\\StataIC-64\"”) and the version of your Stata (e.g., 16) in the RStata.StataVersion option.\nafter indicating the path and version your code should look as specified below\n\noptions(“RStata.StataPath” = “\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Stata15\\Stata-64\"”)\noptions(“RStata.StataVersion” = 15)\n\nOnce you are done, save and close your .Rprofile."

    "text": "What do experts say about Data Science?\nThe statistics profession faces a choice in its future research between continuing concentration on traditional topics – based largely on data analysis supported by mathematical statistics – and a broader viewpoint – based on an inclusive concept of learning from data. The latter course present severe challenges as well as exciting opportunities. The former risks seeing statistics become increasingly marginal… John Chambers1 (Chambers 1993)\n“Data science is the science of learning from data; it studies the methods involved in the analysis and processing of data and proposes technology to improve methods in an evidence-based manner. The scope and impact of this science will expand enormously in coming decades as scientific data and data about science itself become ubiquitously available. David Donoho2 (Donoho 2017).\nPublic health data science is the study of formulating and rigorously answering questions in order to advance health and well-being using a data-centric process that emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, effective communication, and ethical practices. […] Data science implies a perspective that is shaped by […] interdisciplinary work.
