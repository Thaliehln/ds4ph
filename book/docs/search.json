Or what if you realize that a mistake was made and need to re-examine the code, fix the error, and re-run the analysis? Or imagine that someone you are training wants to see the code and be able to reproduce the results to learn about your approach?\nSituations like the ones just described are actually quite common for a data scientist. Here, we describe how you can keep your data science projects organized with RStudio so that re-running an analysis is straight-forward. We then demonstrate how to generate reproducible reports with Quarto in a way that will greatly help with recreating reports with minimal work. This is possible due to the fact that Quarto documents enable code and textual descriptions to be combined into the same document, and the figures and tables produced by the code are automatically added to the document.\nSuch documents can be produced to update on a routine basis (e.g. daily surveillance reports) and/or run on subsets of data (e.g. reports for each jurisdiction).\n\n\n\nWhy are we here?

    "text": "4.2 Background to R Markdown\nQuarto is a tool that allows you integrate your code, text and figures in a single file in order to make high quality, reproducible reports. A paper published with an included quarto file and data sets can be reproduced by anyone with a computer. R Markdown integrates code and natural language in a way that is called “literate programming” (1).\nTo explain some of the concepts and packages involved:\n\nMarkdownR MarkdownrmarkdownQuarto\n\n\nMarkdown is a “language” that allows you to write a document using plain text, that can be converted to html and other formats. It is not specific to R.\nMarkdown files have a md extension.\n\n\nIt is a variation on markdown that is specific to R - it allows you to write a document using markdown to produce text and to embed R code and display their outputs. which was a variant of Markdown specifically designed to allow R code chunks to be included.\nR Markdown is a widely-used tool for creating automated, reproducible, and share-worthy outputs, such as reports. It can generate static or interactive outputs, in Word, pdf, html, powerpoint, and other formats.\nR Markdown files have .Rmd extension.\n\n\nIt is the R package: This is used by R to render the .Rmd file into the desired output.\n\n\nQuarto is the successor to R Markdown. As a R Markdown document, a Quarto document intersperces code and text such that the script actually becomes your output document. You can create an entire formatted document, including narrative text (can be dynamic to change based on your data), tables, figures, bullets/numbers, bibliographies, etc.\nQuatro uses a mark-up language similar to HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or LaTeX, in comparison to a “What You See Is What You Get” (WYSIWYG) language, such as Microsoft Word. This means that all the aspects are consistent, for instance, all top-level heading will look the same. But it means that we use symbols to designate how we would like certain aspects to appear. And it is only when we build the mark-up that we get to see what it looks like. A visual editor option can also be used which hides the need for the user to do this mark-up themselves.\nQuarto is not tied to the R language.\nQuarto files have a .Qmd extension.\n\n\n\n\nknitrPandoc\n\n\nThis R package will read the code chunks, execute it, and ‘knit’ it back into the document. This is how tables and graphs are included alongside the text.\n\n\nPandoc actually convert the output into word/pdf/powerpoint etc. It is a software separate from R but is installed automatically with RStudio.\n\n\n\nThe process that happens in the background involves feeding the .Rmd file to knitr, which executes the R code chunks and creates a new .md (markdown) file which includes the R code and its rendered output. The .md file is then processed by pandoc to create the finished product: a Microsoft Word document, HTML file, powerpoint document, pdf, etc."

    "text": "5.6 Quarto document structure\nAn R Markdown document can be edited in RStudio.\nThere are three basic components to a Quarto document, similar to the components of a R Markdown document:\n\nmetadata (YAML header)\ntext (markdown formatting)\ncode (R code formatting)\n\n\n\nYAML headerTextCode chunks\n\n\nThe very top of the document consists of a (YAML) header surrounded by — lines. Here you may want to edit the title of your document. The other settings in the header define the default document type produced (Microsoft Word) when the RMarkdown is “knit”. the information intended to produce an html output.\n\n\nIn WHITE background areas, any text will appear as regular text in the final report. Can have formatting such as headings, italics, bold, numbers, and bullets. See the second page of this RMarkdown cheatsheet for more detail. Can display parameters derived from your data via in-line code (such as epi week of the outbreak peak, as in the example above).\n\n\nIn gray background “code chunks”, RMarkdown is running R commands. These commands perform data processing and cleaning steps, or could produce visual outputs in the document."

To use Stata within Quarto, you have to use the RStata package, which is a simple R / Stata interface that enables you to:\n\nexecute Stata commands (inline or from a .do file) from R;\npass a data.frame to Stata;\nreturn a data.frame to R;\ninclude Stata chunks in knitr documents (however each chunk is independent from the others; feature tested with LaTeX/Linux).\n\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(RStata)\n```\n\n\n6.4.1 Configure RStudio to execute Stata\n\n6.4.1.1 Find your Stata binary path\nThe function chooseStataBin from the RStata library allows you to browse and set the path to your Stata binary executable.\n```{r}\nstata_bin_path <- RStata::chooseStataBin()\nprint(stata_bin_path)\n```\nWhen you run this code, you should normally get a path which is of the format: “\"C:\\Program Files\\Stata16\\StataIC-64\"”. Note that the .exe extension has been removed from this path. It is important that you keep the format as is, as otherwise your Stata engine will not be recognised.\n\n\n6.4.1.2 Add your Stata binary path to your .Rprofile\nThe Stata binary path setting we just created is just for your current RStudio session and it will be lost once your RStudio is closed. To keep this setting each time you are using RStudio and avoid havin to reconfigure RStata each time you are restarting RStudio, let us add the Stata binary path as an option to .Rprofile, which is your user-specific R configuration file.\n\nlibrary(usethis)\n\nWarning: Paket 'usethis' wurde unter R Version 4.1.3 erstellt\n\n\nUsethis is a workflow package: it automates repetitive tasks that arise during project setup and development, both for R packages and non-package projects.\nThe function edit_r_profile from the usethis library allows to open your configuration file .Rprofile.\n```{r}\nusethis::edit_r_profile(\"user\")\n```\nAdd the following two lines in the Rprofile file that you have just opened:\n\noptions(“RStata.StataPath” = …)\noptions(“RStata.StataVersion” = …)\n\nYou need to indicate the path to your Stata binary executable in the RStata.StataPath option (e.g., “\"C:\\Program Files\\Stata16\\StataIC-64\"”) and the version of your Stata (e.g., 16) in the RStata.StataVersion option.\nafter indicating the path and version your code should look as specified below\n\noptions(“RStata.StataPath” = “\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Stata15\\Stata-64\"”)\noptions(“RStata.StataVersion” = 15)\n\nOnce you are done, save and close your .Rprofile."

It is a more efficient way to ensure that data are always up-to-date.\nWe will see how to retrieve data through the OData API.\n\n✏️ Exercise 5R\n\n\nConnect to the ODK Central server data set. “https://private-anon-24fcfe2426-odkcentral.apiary-mock.com/v1/projects/7/forms/simple.svc”\nYour email is “my.email.address@getodk.org” and your password is “my.super.secure.password”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nR: use the ru_setup function from the ruODK package (2).\nPython: use functions from the pyODK package.\n\n\n\n\n```{r}\n# Write your code here\n```\n\n\n\n\n```{r}\nruODK::ru_setup(\n  svc = \"https://private-anon-24fcfe2426-odkcentral.apiary-mock.com/v1/projects/7/forms/simple.svc\",\n  un = \"my.email.address@getodk.org\",\n  pw = \"my.super.secure.password\",\n  verbose = TRUE\n)\n```\n\n<ruODK settings>\n  Default ODK Central Project ID: 7 \n  Default ODK Central Form ID: simple \n  Default ODK Central URL: https://private-anon-24fcfe2426-odkcentral.apiary-mock.com \n  Default ODK Central Username: my.email.address@getodk.org \n  Default ODK Central Password: run ruODK::get_default_pw() to show \n  Default ODK Central Passphrase: run ruODK::get_default_pp() to show \n  Default Time Zone: UTC \n  Default ODK Central Version: 1.1 \n  Default HTTP GET retries: 3 \n  Verbose messages: TRUE \n  Test ODK Central Project ID:  \n  Test ODK Central Form ID:  \n  Test ODK Central Form ID (ZIP tests):  \n  Test ODK Central Form ID (Attachment tests):  \n  Test ODK Central Form ID (Parsing tests):  \n  Test ODK Central Form ID (WKT tests):  \n  Test ODK Central URL:  \n  Test ODK Central Username:  \n  Test ODK Central Password: run ruODK::get_test_pw() to show \n  Test ODK Central Passphrase: run ruODK::get_test_pp() to show \n  Test ODK Central Version: 1.1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n✏️ Exercise 6R\n\n\nRetrieve data from form and store the data set into a data frame called df4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nR: use the odata_submission_get function from the ruODK package (2).\nPython: use functions from the pyODK package.\n\n\n\n\n```{r}\n# Write your code here\n```\n\n\n\n\n```{r}\nfq_form_schema <- ruODK::form_schema()\n```\n\ni Form schema v1.1\n\n```{r}\nfq_form_schema\n```\n\n# A tibble: 5 x 5\n  name       path             type      binary ruodk_name      \n  <chr>      <chr>            <chr>     <lgl>  <chr>           \n1 meta       /meta            structure NA     meta            \n2 instanceID /meta/instanceID string    NA     meta_instance_id\n3 name       /name            string    NA     name            \n4 age        /age             int       NA     age             \n5 photo      /photo           binary    TRUE   photo           \n\n\n\n```{r}\ndf <- ruODK::odata_service_get()\ndf\n```\n\n# A tibble: 0 x 3\n# ... with 3 variables: name <chr>, kind <chr>, url <chr>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nEncrypted data can only be retrieved using the RESTful API and cannot be retrieved using the oData API. ODK Central supports two modes of encryption - learn about them here. ruODK supports project managed encryption, however the support is limited to exactly one encryption key. The supplied passphrase will be used against the first returned encryption key. Remaining encryption keys are ignored by ruODK.\nIf an incorrect passphrase is given, the request is terminated immediately. It has been reported that multiple requests with incorrect passphrases can crash ODK Central.\n\n```{r}\ndf <- ruODK::submission_export()\n```\n\n<U+2714> Overwriting previous download: \"C:/Users/langhe/switchdrive/Private/Code/R/github/ds4ph/book/simple.zip\"\n\n```{r}\ndf\n```\n\nC:/Users/langhe/switchdrive/Private/Code/R/github/ds4ph/book/simple.zip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

You can still use another mirror since the closest geographic location does not always give the best mirror.\n\n\nFor instance, when downloading R from Tanzania, you can select the mirror from South Africa.\n\n\nOnce on the CRAN page, select your operating system: Linux, macOS, or Windows.\n\n\n\nSelect binaries for base distribution\n\n\n\nDownload the installer\n\n\n\n\nAfter downloading the installer, follow the installation wizard on your computer."

Base packages contain the basic functions that allow R to work, and enable standard statistical and graphical functions on data sets.\n\n\nTo install packages\n```{r}\ninstall.packages(\"rmarkdown\")\n```\nInstallation of the rmarkdown package will also install the knitr package so you will have everything required to render documents containing R code.\nQuarto will select a version of R by looking on the system PATH. In addition, on Windows when R is not found on the PATH, the registry will be scanned for the current R version. You can override the version of R used by Quarto by setting the QUARTO_R environment variable."
