    "text": "5.2 Background to R Markdown\nThis is possible due to the fact that Quarto documents enable code and textual descriptions to be combined into the same document, and the figures and tables produced by the code are automatically added to the document.\nQuarto is a tool that allows you integrate your code, text and figures in a single file in order to make high quality, reproducible reports. A paper published with an included quarto file and data sets can be reproduced by anyone with a computer. R Markdown integrates code and natural language in a way that is called ‚Äúliterate programming‚Äù (1).\nTo explain some of the concepts and packages involved:\n\nMarkdownR MarkdownrmarkdownQuarto\n\n\nMarkdown is a ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù that allows you to write a document using plain text, that can be converted to html and other formats. It is not specific to R.\nMarkdown files have a md extension.\n\n\nIt is a variation on markdown that is specific to R - it allows you to write a document using markdown to produce text and to embed R code and display their outputs. which was a variant of Markdown specifically designed to allow R code chunks to be included.\nR Markdown is a widely-used tool for creating automated, reproducible, and share-worthy outputs, such as reports. It can generate static or interactive outputs, in Word, pdf, html, powerpoint, and other formats.\nR Markdown files have .Rmd extension.\n\n\nIt is the R package: This is used by R to render the .Rmd file into the desired output.\n\n\nQuarto is the successor to R Markdown. As a R Markdown document, a Quarto document intersperces code and text such that the script actually becomes your output document. You can create an entire formatted document, including narrative text (can be dynamic to change based on your data), tables, figures, bullets/numbers, bibliographies, etc.\nQuatro uses a mark-up language similar to HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or LaTeX, in comparison to a ‚ÄúWhat You See Is What You Get‚Äù (WYSIWYG) language, such as Microsoft Word. This means that all the aspects are consistent, for instance, all top-level heading will look the same. But it means that we use symbols to designate how we would like certain aspects to appear. And it is only when we build the mark-up that we get to see what it looks like. A visual editor option can also be used which hides the need for the user to do this mark-up themselves.\nQuarto is not tied to the R language.\nQuarto files have a .Qmd extension.\n\n\n\n\nknitrPandoc\n\n\nThis R package will read the code chunks, execute it, and ‚Äòknit‚Äô it back into the document. This is how tables and graphs are included alongside the text.\n\n\nPandoc actually convert the output into word/pdf/powerpoint etc. It is a software separate from R but is installed automatically with RStudio.\n\n\n\n\nThe process that happens in the background involves feeding the .Rmd file to knitr, which executes the R code chunks and creates a new .md (markdown) file which includes the R code and its rendered output. The .md file is then processed by Pandoc to create the final product: a Microsoft Word document, HTML file, PowerPoint document, PDF, etc.\n\nüí¨ Discussion\n\n\nForm small groups of 2-4 with your neighbours and discuss how you expect learning Quarto might benefit you.\nüïí 5 minutes"

R Studio will enable you select options to pick from to generate a template Quarto document to start from.\nThe title and the author names are not important.

    "text": "8.4 Execute Stata commands within R code chunks\nStata is not a language supported by Quarto. To use Stata within Quarto, you have to use the RStata R package, which is a simple R / Stata interface that enables you to:\n\nexecute Stata commands (inline or from a .do file) from R;\npass a data frame to Stata;\nreturn Stata outputs (including modified data frames) to R.\n\n\n```{r}\nif ( !require(RStata) ) {\n  install.packages('RStata')\n}\nlibrary(RStata)\n```\n\n\n8.4.1 Configure RStudio to execute Stata\n\n8.4.1.1 Find your Stata binary path\nThe function chooseStataBin from the RStata library allows you to browse and set the path to your Stata binary executable.\n```{r}\nstata_bin_path <- RStata::chooseStataBin()\nprint(stata_bin_path)\n```\nWhen you run this code, you should normally get a path which is of the format: ‚Äú\"C:\\Program Files\\Stata16\\StataIC-64\"‚Äù. Note that the .exe extension has been removed from this path. It is important that you keep the format as is, as otherwise your Stata engine will not be recognised.\n\n\n8.4.1.2 Add your Stata binary path to your .Rprofile\nThe Stata binary path setting we just created is just for your current RStudio session and it will be lost once your RStudio is closed. To keep this setting each time you are using RStudio and avoid havin to reconfigure RStata each time you are restarting RStudio, let us add the Stata binary path as an option to .Rprofile, which is your user-specific R configuration file.\n\nlibrary(usethis)\n\nUsethis is a workflow package: it automates repetitive tasks that arise during project setup and development, both for R packages and non-package projects.\nThe function edit_r_profile from the usethis library allows to open your configuration file .Rprofile.\n```{r}\nusethis::edit_r_profile(\"user\")\n```\nAdd the following two lines in the Rprofile file that you have just opened:\n\noptions(‚ÄúRStata.StataPath‚Äù = ‚Ä¶)\noptions(‚ÄúRStata.StataVersion‚Äù = ‚Ä¶)\n\nYou need to indicate the path to your Stata binary executable in the RStata.StataPath option (e.g., ‚Äú\"C:\\Program Files\\Stata16\\StataIC-64\"‚Äù) and the version of your Stata (e.g., 16) in the RStata.StataVersion option.\nafter indicating the path and version your code should look as specified below\n\noptions(‚ÄúRStata.StataPath‚Äù = ‚Äú\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Stata15\\Stata-64\"‚Äù)\noptions(‚ÄúRStata.StataVersion‚Äù = 15)\n\nOnce you are done, save and close your .Rprofile."

Base packages contain the basic functions that allow R to work, and enable standard statistical and graphical functions on data sets.\n\n\nThe rmarkdown package will add all necessary functionalities in your R installation to render Quarto documents that use R.\n\nStep 1Step 2Step 3\n\n\nOpen RStudio on your computer\n\n\nIn RStudio, you can install a new package by selecting Tools > Install packages‚Ä¶"
