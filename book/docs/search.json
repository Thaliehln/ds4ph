The goal of this section is to briefly discuss why we want to learn quarto, the benefits, and the barriers to using it.\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the value in a reproducible report?\nWhat is Quarto?\nCan I combine my software and my writing?\n\nThink about why you want to use Quarto\n\nImagine that after you finish the analysis and the report, you are told that you were given the wrong data set, you are sent a new one and you are asked to run the same analysis with this new data set. Or what if you realize that a mistake was made and need to re-examine the code, fix the error, and re-run the analysis? Or imagine that someone you are training wants to see the code and be able to reproduce the results to learn about your approach?\nSituations like the ones just described are actually quite common for a data scientist. Here, we describe how you can keep your data science projects organized with RStudio so that re-running an analysis is straight-forward. We then demonstrate how to generate reproducible reports with Quarto in a way that will greatly help with recreating reports with minimal work. This is possible due to the fact that Quarto documents enable code and textual descriptions to be combined into the same document, and the figures and tables produced by the code are automatically added to the document.\nSuch documents can be produced to update on a routine basis (e.g. daily surveillance reports) and/or run on subsets of data (e.g. reports for each jurisdiction).\n\n\n\nWhy are we here?

    "text": "4.2 Background to R Markdown\nQuarto is a tool that allows you integrate your code, text and figures in a single file in order to make high quality, reproducible reports. A paper published with an included quarto file and data sets can be reproduced by anyone with a computer. R Markdown integrates code and natural language in a way that is called “literate programming” (1).\nTo explain some of the concepts and packages involved:\n\nMarkdownR MarkdownrmarkdownQuarto\n\n\nMarkdown is a “language” that allows you to write a document using plain text, that can be converted to html and other formats. It is not specific to R.\nMarkdown files have a md extension.\n\n\nIt is a variation on markdown that is specific to R - it allows you to write a document using markdown to produce text and to embed R code and display their outputs. which was a variant of Markdown specifically designed to allow R code chunks to be included.\nR Markdown is a widely-used tool for creating automated, reproducible, and share-worthy outputs, such as reports. It can generate static or interactive outputs, in Word, pdf, html, powerpoint, and other formats.\nR Markdown files have .Rmd extension.\n\n\nIt is the R package: This is used by R to render the .Rmd file into the desired output.\n\n\nQuarto is the successor to R Markdown. As a R Markdown document, a Quarto document intersperces code and text such that the script actually becomes your output document. You can create an entire formatted document, including narrative text (can be dynamic to change based on your data), tables, figures, bullets/numbers, bibliographies, etc.\nQuatro uses a mark-up language similar to HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or LaTeX, in comparison to a “What You See Is What You Get” (WYSIWYG) language, such as Microsoft Word. This means that all the aspects are consistent, for instance, all top-level heading will look the same. But it means that we use symbols to designate how we would like certain aspects to appear. And it is only when we build the mark-up that we get to see what it looks like. A visual editor option can also be used which hides the need for the user to do this mark-up themselves.\nQuarto is not tied to the R language.\nQuarto files have a .Qmd extension.\n\n\n\n\nknitrPandoc\n\n\nThis R package will read the code chunks, execute it, and ‘knit’ it back into the document. This is how tables and graphs are included alongside the text.\n\n\nPandoc actually convert the output into word/pdf/powerpoint etc. It is a software separate from R but is installed automatically with RStudio.\n\n\n\nThe process that happens in the background involves feeding the .Rmd file to knitr, which executes the R code chunks and creates a new .md (markdown) file which includes the R code and its rendered output. The .md file is then processed by pandoc to create the finished product: a Microsoft Word document, HTML file, powerpoint document, pdf, etc."

    "text": "5.4 Execute Stata commands within R code chunks\nStata is not a language supported by Quarto. To use Stata within Quarto, you have to use the RStata package, which is a simple R / Stata interface that enables you to:\n\nexecute Stata commands (inline or from a .do file) from R;\npass a data.frame to Stata;\nreturn a data.frame to R;\ninclude Stata chunks in knitr documents (however each chunk is independent from the others; feature tested with LaTeX/Linux).\n\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(RStata)\n```\n\n\n5.4.1 Configure RStudio to execute Stata\n\n5.4.1.1 Find your Stata binary path\nThe function chooseStataBin from the RStata library allows you to browse and set the path to your Stata binary executable.\n```{r}\nstata_bin_path <- RStata::chooseStataBin()\nprint(stata_bin_path)\n```\nWhen you run this code, you should normally get a path which is of the format: “\"C:\\Program Files\\Stata16\\StataIC-64\"”. Note that the .exe extension has been removed from this path. It is important that you keep the format as is, as otherwise your Stata engine will not be recognised.\n\n\n5.4.1.2 Add your Stata binary path to your .Rprofile\nThe Stata binary path setting we just created is just for your current RStudio session and it will be lost once your RStudio is closed. To keep this setting each time you are using RStudio and avoid havin to reconfigure RStata each time you are restarting RStudio, let us add the Stata binary path as an option to .Rprofile, which is your user-specific R configuration file.\n\nlibrary(usethis)\n\nWarning: Paket 'usethis' wurde unter R Version 4.1.3 erstellt\n\n\nUsethis is a workflow package: it automates repetitive tasks that arise during project setup and development, both for R packages and non-package projects.\nThe function edit_r_profile from the usethis library allows to open your configuration file .Rprofile.\n```{r}\nusethis::edit_r_profile(\"user\")\n```\nAdd the following two lines in the Rprofile file that you have just opened:\n\noptions(“RStata.StataPath” = …)\noptions(“RStata.StataVersion” = …)\n\nYou need to indicate the path to your Stata binary executable in the RStata.StataPath option (e.g., “\"C:\\Program Files\\Stata16\\StataIC-64\"”) and the version of your Stata (e.g., 16) in the RStata.StataVersion option.\nafter indicating the path and version your code should look as specified below\n\noptions(“RStata.StataPath” = “\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Stata15\\Stata-64\"”)\noptions(“RStata.StataVersion” = 15)\n\nOnce you are done, save and close your .Rprofile."

    "text": "What do experts say about Data Science?\nThe statistics profession faces a choice in its future research between continuing concentration on traditional topics – based largely on data analysis supported by mathematical statistics – and a broader viewpoint – based on an inclusive concept of learning from data. The latter course present severe challenges as well as exciting opportunities. The former risks seeing statistics become increasingly marginal… John Chambers1 (Chambers 1993)\n“Data science is the science of learning from data; it studies the methods involved in the analysis and processing of data and proposes technology to improve methods in an evidence-based manner. The scope and impact of this science will expand enormously in coming decades as scientific data and data about science itself become ubiquitously available. David Donoho2 (Donoho 2017).\nPublic health data science is the study of formulating and rigorously answering questions in order to advance health and well-being using a data-centric process that emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, effective communication, and ethical practices. […] Data science implies a perspective that is shaped by […] interdisciplinary work.

The Ifakara Health Institute has approved the use of this data for training purposes. Please note, that some data has been adapted in order to best achieve training objectives. No personally indentifiable information have been kept in this dataset.\nInformation about the consultations of 10,308 children [1 day - 59 months] from 18 facilities (dispensaries and health centres) in Kaliua District, Sengerema District and Tanga District, Tanzania. Data were collected using ODK (ODK Collect, ODK Central) between start date and end date. Data were made available by IHI and Swiss TPH and the Tools for Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (TIMCI) project. Data are stored in dataset1.dta.\nThe outbreak linelist data was combined data from the active CBS data and the clinical data from the hospital. The CBS functioned with community health workers visiting all households in the town every two weeks and actively searching for people with Acute Jaundice Syndrome (AJS). For this group of persons (suspected cases), only those that were visibly ill or that were pregnant were referred to the hospital for clinical assessment and admission if required. Persons that self-reported to the hospital or that arrived after referral would undergo a clinical assessment and a rapid test for HEV for diagnosis. Thus only for people assessed at the hospital were we able to capture a confirmed case status.\nFor the duration of the outbreak we detected 1193 suspected cases, 100 confirmed cases and discarded 150 cases with AJS who were not positive for HEV infection.\n\n\n9.3.2 Data collection\nResearch assistants recorded the following information from different sources:\n\nfrom the caregiver:\n\nsociodemographic information\ninformation on treatment received before consultation\nclinical presentation (variables starting with the suffix CLIN)\nlaboratory investigations (variables starting with the suffix TEST)\ndiagnosis (variables starting with the suffix DX)\nprescribed medication (variables starting with the suffix RX)\nreferral advice will be extracted from clinical notes and / or facility registers (variables starting with the suffix MGMT).\n\n\nResearch assistants sought clarification from healthcare providers only in cases where these variables were not clear from the records."

    "text": "4.4 Introduction\nThe goal of this section is to briefly discuss why we want to learn quarto, the benefits, and the barriers to using it.\nImagine that after you finish the analysis and the report, you are told that you were given the wrong data set, you are sent a new one and you are asked to run the same analysis with this new data set. Or what if you realize that a mistake was made and need to re-examine the code, fix the error, and re-run the analysis? Or imagine that someone you are training wants to see the code and be able to reproduce the results to learn about your approach?\nSituations like the ones just described are actually quite common for a data scientist. Here, we describe how you can keep your data science projects organized with RStudio so that re-running an analysis is straight-forward. We then demonstrate how to generate reproducible reports with Quarto in a way that will greatly help with recreating reports with minimal work. This is possible due to the fact that Quarto documents enable code and textual descriptions to be combined into the same document, and the figures and tables produced by the code are automatically added to the document.\nSuch documents can be produced to update on a routine basis (e.g. daily surveillance reports) and/or run on subsets of data (e.g. reports for each jurisdiction)."

This includes information on the data, tools, methods, codes, and documentation used in the research project. By storing a complete track-record of our work, we can ensure research sustainability, fair citation/acknowledgement, and usefulness of our and others’ work in our research fields.\nFacilitate collaboration and review process By designing reproducible workflows and sharing them with the different components of our research project, we can allow others to develop an in-depth understanding of our work. This encourages them to review our methods, test our code, propose useful changes and make thoughtful contributions to develop our project further. Reproducible workflows facilitate the peer review process tremendously by allowing reviewers access to the different parts of the projects that are necessary to validate the research outcomes.\nPublish validated research and avoid misinformation Lack of reproducibility is one of the major factors that lead to paper retractions (source Retraction Watch). The best-known analyses of scientific literature in psychology [BE12] and cancer biology [OpenSCollaboration15] found the reproducibility rates of their research output of around 40% and 10%, respectively. By working reproducibly, we can develop validated research work, avoid misinformation that can limit replicability of our work and publish accurate research outputs. This aspect does not only support the validity of the current work, but any future studies that are based on reproducible research [Lab16].\nWrite your papers, thesis and reports efficiently Well documented analyses help us maintain easy access to all the results generated within a project that can be written up efficiently. If working in a team, collaborators can easily get recognition in terms of authorship for their contributions. Furthermore, by availing the underlying dataset and methods we can easily comply with the highest-level journal guidelines.\nGet credits for your work fairly Applying reproducibility practices separately on different parts of the project such as data, independently executable codes and scripts, protocols, and reports allow other researchers to test and reuse our work in their research and brings fair recognition for our work. Researchers who publish their work with the underlying information, get cited more often as their research outcome can be broadly replicated and trusted. This fair credit system encourages researchers to further maintain reproducibility practices in their work.\nEnsure continuity of your work By following guidelines for reproducibility, we can easily communicate our work with different stakeholders such as our supervisors, funders, reviewers, students, and potential collaborators. This aspect of reproducibility increases the usefulness of our research by enabling others to easily build on our results, and re-use our research materials [Lab16]. This ensures the continuity of a research idea and can even find fresh applications in other contexts. Progress of such projects can easily be tracked and continued - either by other researchers, or yourself if you want to build on your own work after a longer period [Mar15]."
