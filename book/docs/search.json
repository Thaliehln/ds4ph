Base packages contain the basic functions that allow R to work, and enable standard statistical and graphical functions on data sets.\n\n\nThe rmarkdown package will add all necessary functionalities in your R installation to render Quarto documents that use R.\n\nStep 1Step 2Step 3\n\n\nOpen RStudio on your computer\n\n\nIn RStudio, you can install a new package by selecting Tools > Install packages‚Ä¶"
