## Introduction

### Overview

Does the following situation seem sadly familiar? The challenge here is not only that you have no idea which draft is actually the latest version of the document, but also that it is almost impossible to understand what decision on the document content was taken when.

Version control is the process by which the development of a document is clearly identified. It provides huge benefits to organization, archiving, and being able to find your files easily when you need them. Git is a tool that

### Learning objectives

In this chapter, we introduce the basic elements of version control. We will learn the terminology and practice version control on a *need-to-know* basis across the workshop.

-   What is version control?

-   What tools are available to support version control?

-   How to set up Git version control for a project?

## Version control

Version control generally applies at a level of a project. It tracks and manages different drafts and versions for each document in the project.

::: callout-important
With version control, you will only see a single file, which is the most recent version (*final* version). This helps avoiding confusion.
:::

Version control provides an audit trail for the revisions and updates of final versions.

::: callout-tip
Version control tracks **what** changes have been made, **by whom** and **when**, so that you do no longer need to save a copy of your documents with your name or the date in the filename.
:::

Version control allows you to discard recent updates and restore an earlier version of our project if needed.

## Git, GitHub and GitHub Desktop

We will always use these three tools together.

Please refer to the following sections for instructions on creation/installation steps:

-   Create a GitHub account (@sec-GitHub-account-creation)
-   Install GitHub Desktop (@sec-GitHub-Desktop-installation)

## Set up Git version control for a project

::: callout-note
A **repository** is a database of all changes in your project. You will have a personal copy of all the final versions of the documents in the project (*working copy*) which will appear on your computer as a folder.
:::

### Step 1

Open GitHub Desktop

### Step 2

In GitHub Desktop, you can create a new repository by selecting **File** \> **New repository**.

![](images/paste-A85BE0C6.png)

### Step 3

1.  Enter **data_science_workshop_sept_2022** as the name of your new repository.
2.  Click **Choose...** to select the local directory in which your new repository will be created. Using Windows Explorer, navigate to the local repository of your choice.
3.  Check **Initialize this repository with a README** to create a README file in your new repository. This is *optional* and you will be able to create a README file later if you wish to do so.
4.  Click on **Create repository**.
