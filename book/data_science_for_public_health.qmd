:clock3: 3 minutes: You have probably already heard about data science as this is a main Data Science is today one of the main buzzwords, but what does **Data Science** mean for you?

### Quote 1 :speech_balloon:

<q>The statistics profession faces a choice in its future research between continuing concentration on traditional topics -- based largely on data analysis supported by mathematical statistics -- and a broader viewpoint -- based on an inclusive concept of **learning from data**. The latter course present severe challenges as well as exciting opportunities. The former risks seeing statistics become increasingly marginal...</q> [@chambers93]

### Quote 2 :speech_balloon:

<q>Data science is the science of **learning from data**; it studies the methods involved in the analysis and processing of data and proposes technology to **improve methods in an evidence-based manner**. The scope and impact of this science will expand enormously in coming decades as scientific data and data about science itself become ubiquitously available.</q> [@donoho17].

### Quote 1

-   Growing field with computational power and data generation
-   Set of collective evidence-based processes, theories, concepts, tools and technologies
-   Extraction of valuable knowledge and information from data (learning from data)
:::

Qualitative thinking currently does not receive nearly as much attention as quantitative thinking in data science.

<q>Public health data science is the study of formulating and rigorously answering questions in order to advance health and well-being using a data-centric process that emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, effective communication, and ethical practices. […] Data science implies a perspective that is shaped by […] interdisciplinary work.</q> Goldsmith J, Sun Y, Fried LP, Wing J, Miller GW and Berhane K (2021) The Emergence and Future of Public Health Data Science.

## A tentative definition

NIH defines data science as "the interdisciplinary field of inquiry in which quantitative and analytical approaches, processes, and systems are developed and used to extract knowledge and insights from increasingly large and/or complex sets of data"

In this book, we define data science as

Data science is an interdisciplinary collaborative field
that tries to answer rigorously formulated public health questions
by relying on a set of collective evidence-based processes, theories, concepts, tools and technologies
that enable the extraction of valuable knowledge and information from data
to generate actionable insights
that effectively communicated to decision-makers
can advance health and well-being.

-   Interdisciplinary collaborative field
-   Rigorous public health question formulation
-   Set of collective evidence-based processes, theories, concepts, tools and technologies
-   Extraction of valuable knowledge and information from data
-   Generation of actionable insights
-   Effective communication to decision-makers
