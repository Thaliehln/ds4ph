# Data Science for Public Health

## Description

Data science and artificial intelligence have the potential to generate fundamentally new insights on global health policies in Africa, but the full realization of this potential depends on the availability of a critical mass of highly trained health data scientists on the continent. The goal of this project is to jointly develop and implement a public health data science curriculum to enable researchers from the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) in Tanzania to strengthen their expertise in the area.

## Objectives

This project aims to accompany researchers to progress on the following development axes:

* General axis
    * [Use of reproducible research practices in public health](https://github.com/Thaliehln/ds4ph/wiki/1.-Use-of-reproducible-research-practices-in-public-health)
    * Data provenance
        * Use of distinct data sources for the development of public health indicators
        * Research data vs. real world evidence data
    * Ethical data science
    * Data papers
* Open-source computational tools for reproducible data science (technical axis)
    * Programming tools
        * [Move from Stata to R](https://github.com/Thaliehln/ds4ph/wiki/Moving-from-Stata-to-R) (prerequisite: Stata)
        * R programming
            * dplyr
        * Python programming
            * pandas
            * scikit-learn (prerequisite: independent Python user)
    * Code quality
        * Versioning using GitHub (all)
        * Using targets (prerequisite: independent R user)
    * Reproducible environments
        * Using Binder
        * Using Docker (advanced)
        * Using renv (prerequisite: independent R user)

This project is developed with the support of the [Leading House Africa (LHA)](https://www.swisstph.ch/en/research/leading-house-africa/) which promotes and fosters bilateral collaboration with partner institutions in Africa.

This GitHub R project relies on **bookdown** and was initiated from the [minimal example](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) provided by the developers.
