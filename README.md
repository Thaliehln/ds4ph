# Data Science for Public Health

This workshop is being developed by the [Ifakara Health Institute (IHI)](https://ihi.or.tz/) and the [Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH)](https://www.swisstph.ch), with the support of the [Leading House Africa (LHA)](https://www.swisstph.ch/en/research/leading-house-africa/) which promotes and fosters bilateral collaboration with partner institutions in Africa.

## Overview

Data science and artificial intelligence have the potential to generate fundamentally new insights on global health policies in Africa, but the full realization of this potential depends on the availability of a critical mass of highly trained health data scientists on the continent. The goal of this project is to jointly develop and implement a public health data science curriculum to enable researchers from the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) in Tanzania to strengthen their expertise in the area.

## Learning objectives

Two complementary aspects of moving into data science are:

1. the mindset about how scientists think and collaborate about data, and
2. the skillsets which is composed of an ecosystem of tools (mostly open-source) and practices.

Upon completing the workshop, participants will have gained:

* exposure to data science approach, tools and collaborative practices
* hands-on experience on how to interface between Stata and R, learned the basics of working with data in R/RStudio, and how to incrementally incorporate R into your existing data analysis workflows in Stata. The idea is not to replace everything you do in Stata into R but that you can continue your learning after this workshop at your own pace.

## Is this workshop for me?

This workshop is relevant for individuals who answer yes to the following questions:

- [ ] Do you who want to develop data science projects in public health?
- [ ] Do you wants to learn more about how open and reproducible science approaches can be used in your daily practice?
- [ ] Are you a Stata user (or any other data analysis language) who would like to expand your data analysis skillset with R?
- [ ] Do you want to bridge analyses between data analysis tools (Stata, R or Python) and to more easily collaborate with other researchers who use another of these tools?
