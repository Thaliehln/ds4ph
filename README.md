# Data Science for Public Health

## Description

Data science and artificial intelligence have the potential to generate fundamentally new insights on global health policies in Africa, but the full realization of this potential depends on the availability of a critical mass of highly trained health data scientists on the continent. The goal of this project is to jointly develop and implement a public health data science curriculum to enable researchers from the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) in Tanzania to strengthen their expertise in the area.

## Objectives

This project aims to accompany researchers to progress on the following development axes:

* General axis
    * [Use of reproducible research practices in public health](https://github.com/Thaliehln/ds4ph/wiki/1.-Use-of-reproducible-research-practices-in-public-health)
    * Data provenance
        * Use of distinct data sources for the development of public health indicators
        * Research data vs. real world evidence data
* Open-source computational tools for reproducible research (technical axis)
    * Code
        * [Move from Stata to R](https://github.com/Thaliehln/ds4ph/wiki/Moving-from-Stata-to-R) (prerequisite: Stata)
        * Use R for Data Science (prerequisite: independent R user)
        * Use Python for Data Science (prerequisite: independent Python user)
            * scikit-learn
    * Reproducible code
        * Versioning with GitHub
        * Using Docker
    * Reproducible documentation (dynamic report generation)
        * Using Stata (prerequisite: Stata)
        * Using R/Rmarkdown (prerequisite: R basics)
        * Notebooks
    * Reproducible data
    * Statistical methods for reproducible science

This project is developed with the support of the [Leading House Africa (LHA)](https://www.swisstph.ch/en/research/leading-house-africa/) which promotes and fosters bilateral collaboration with partner institutions in Africa.

This GitHub R project relies on **bookdown** and was initiated from the [minimal example](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) provided by the developers.
