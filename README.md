# Data Science for Public Health

Data science and artificial intelligence have the potential to generate fundamentally new insights on global health policies in Africa, but the full realization of this potential depends on the availability of a critical mass of highly trained health data scientists on the continent. The goal of this project is to jointly develop and implement a public health data science curriculum to enable researchers from the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) in Tanzania to develop expertise in the area.
