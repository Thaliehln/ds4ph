# Data Science for Public Health

This workshop has been developed by the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) and the Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH), with the support of the [Leading House Africa (LHA)](https://www.swisstph.ch/en/research/leading-house-africa/) which promotes and fosters bilateral collaboration with partner institutions in Africa.

## Overview

Data science and artificial intelligence have the potential to generate fundamentally new insights on global health policies in Africa, but the full realization of this potential depends on the availability of a critical mass of highly trained health data scientists on the continent. The goal of this project is to jointly develop and implement a public health data science curriculum to enable researchers from the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) in Tanzania to strengthen their expertise in the area.

## Learning objectives

Two complementary aspects of moving into data science are:

1. the mindset about how scientists think and collaborate about data, and
2. the skillsets which is composed of an ecosystem of tools (mostly open-source) and practices.

Upon completing the workshop, participants will have gained:

* hands-on experience on how to interface between Stata and R, learned the basics of working with data in R/RStudio, and how to incrementally incorporate R into your existing data analysis workflows in Stata. The idea is not to replace everything you do in Stata into R but that you can continue your learning after this workshop at your own pace.
* R individually and as collaborators.

This project aims to accompany researchers to progress on the following development axes:

* Data science mindset
    * [Use of reproducible research practices in public health](https://github.com/Thaliehln/ds4ph/wiki/1.-Use-of-reproducible-research-practices-in-public-health)
    * Data provenance
        * Use of distinct data sources for the development of public health indicators
        * Research data vs. real world evidence data
    * Ethical data science
    * Data papers
* Data science skillset
    * Programming tools
        * [Move from Stata to R](https://github.com/Thaliehln/ds4ph/wiki/Moving-from-Stata-to-R) (prerequisite: Stata)
        * R programming
            * dplyr
        * Python programming
            * pandas
            * scikit-learn (prerequisite: independent Python user)
    * Coding with best practices (R/RStudio/tidyverse)
        * Versioning using GitHub (all)
        * Using targets (prerequisite: independent R user)
    * Reproducible environments
        * Using Binder
        * Using Docker (advanced)
        * Using renv (prerequisite: independent R user)
    * Reporting and publishing: Dynamic report generation
        * Using Stata (prerequisite: Stata)
        * Using R/Rmarkdown (prerequisite: R basics)
        * Notebooks (Python Jupyter Notebook, Rmarkdown as a notebook - prerequisite: Python/R basics)
    * Reproducible data
        * Use APIs (prerequisite: IT programming basics)
        * Open access data (all)
    * Statistical methods for reproducible research (advanced)

## Is this workshop for me?

This workshop is relevant for individuals who answer yes to the following questions:

- [ ] Are you a researcher who wants to develop data science projects in public health?
- [ ] Are you a researcher who wants to rely on open and reproducible science approaches?
- [ ] Are you a researcher (Stata user - strong quantitative background (data managers, data scientists, clinicians with basic coding skills)) who wants to expand your data analysis toolset with R?
- [ ] Are you a reseracher who wants to bridge analyses between data analysis tools (Stata, R or Python) or to more easily collaborate with collaborators who use another tool?
