## What does Data Science mean?

![](images/paste-EC17C23A.png)

## What do statisticians say about Data Science? (1)

<q>The statistics profession faces a choice in its future research between continuing concentration on traditional topics -- based largely on data analysis supported by mathematical statistics -- and a broader viewpoint -- based on an inclusive concept of learning from data. The latter course present severe challenges as well as exciting opportunities. The former risks seeing statistics become increasingly marginal...</q> John Chambers[^1] [@chambers93]

[^1]: John Chambers is a PhD in Statistics, the creator of the S programming language, and a core member of the R programming language project.

## What do statisticians say about Data Science? (2)

<q>Data science is the science of learning from data; it studies the methods involved in the analysis and processing of data and proposes technology to improve methods in an evidence-based manner. The scope and impact of this science will expand enormously in coming decades as scientific data and data about science itself become ubiquitously available.</q> David Donoho[^2] [@donoho17].

[^2]: David Donoho is a Professor of Statistics at Stanford University.

## What do statisticians say about Data Science? (3)

-   Growing field with computational power and data generation
-   Set of collective evidence-based processes, theories, concepts, tools and technologies
-   Extraction of valuable knowledge and information from data (learning from data)

## What do public health experts say about Data Science? (1)

<q>Public health data science is the study of formulating and rigorously answering questions in order to advance health and well-being using a data-centric process that emphasizes clarity, reproducibility, effective communication, and ethical practices. \[...\] Data science implies a perspective that is shaped by \[...\] interdisciplinary work.</q> [@goldsmith_emergence_2021].

## What do public health experts say about Public Health Data Science? (2)

NIH defines data science as "the interdisciplinary field of inquiry in which quantitative and analytical approaches, processes, and systems are developed and used to extract knowledge and insights from increasingly large and/or complex sets of data"

## Data Science for Public Health - A tentative definition

-   Interdisciplinary collaborative field
-   Rigorous public health question formulation
-   Set of collective evidence-based processes, theories, concepts, tools and technologies
-   Extraction of valuable knowledge and information from data
-   Generation of actionable insights
-   Effective communication to decision-makers

::: notes
Data science is an interdisciplinary collaborative field that tries to answer rigorously formulated public health questions by relying on a set of collective evidence-based processes, theories, concepts, tools and technologies that enable the extraction of valuable knowledge and information from data to generate actionable insights that effectively communicated to decision-makers can advance health and well-being.

## Sources of uncertainty (1)

Generalizing from a sample to a population is inherently uncertain

![](images/paste-9F782B2B.png)

## Sources of uncertainty (2)

-   Use data to make predictions about the future (we expect the future to be similar to the past)
-   Measurement or reporting errors

## How to collaborate and share your code using Git

![](images/paste-ADC9719C.png)

##  {.unnumbered}

Even if we do not take advantage of the advanced and powerful version control functionality, we can still use Git and GitHub to share our code.

Once you set up a central repository, you can have multiple people make changes to code and keep versions synced.

GitHub provides a free service for centralized repositories. GitHub also has a special utility, called a pull request, that can be used by anybody to suggest changes to your code. You can easily either accept or deny the request.

## Synchronise a remote GitHub repository on your computer
