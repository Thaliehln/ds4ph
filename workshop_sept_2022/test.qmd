## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
t <- 2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{python}
import numpy as np
mylist = [r.t, 1, 2, 3]
print(mylist)
```

```{r}
library(RStata)
```

```{r}
df = iris
RStata::stata("tab Species", data.in = df)
```

```{r}
RStata::stata("codebook", data.in = df)
```
