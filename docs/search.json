    "text": "Data science and artificial intelligence have the potential to generate fundamentally new insights on global health policies in Africa, but the full realization of this potential depends on the availability of a critical mass of highly trained health data scientists on the continent.\nThis electronic book was created by H√©l√®ne Langet, Fenella Beynon, Fabian Sch√§r, Silvia Cicconi and Gillian Levine from the Swiss Tropical & Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) and Samwel Lwambura (IHI) from the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) to accompany the Data Science for Public Health workshop which will be held in Dar-es-Salaam from Monday,September 26th to Wednesday, September 28th 2022.\nThe goal of this workshop is to enable researchers from the Ifakara Health Institute (IHI) to strengthen their expertise in the area and to lay the foundations for the development of a data science curriculum that is adapted to IHI‚Äôs needs.\nThis work is the product of interdisciplinary discussions with Abdallah Mkopi, Grace Mhalu, Robert Moshiro from IHI and feedback from Hajirani Msuya and Martine Masonda, the first group to use these notebooks.\n\n\n\n This book is licensed under a Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).\nYou are free to:\n\nShare ‚Äî copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format\nAdapt ‚Äî remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.\n\nUnder the following terms:\n\nAttribution ‚Äî You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.

The idea is not to replace everything you do in Stata into R but that you can continue your learning after this workshop at your own pace."
