# Markdown exercises

Please create here a folder identified with your name (e.g., `firstname_lastname`) and store in this folder all the tests and exercises using R markdown that you want to share or receive feedback on.

Do not display datasets that contain personally identifiable data (names, dates of birth, adresses, etc) from real patients and do not display confidential data as this repository is public and can be visible by anybody on the Internet.

Several exercices will be available in order for you to explore the different functionalities associated with R Markdown and give you opportunities to practice and get feedback.
